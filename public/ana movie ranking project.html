<h3>2. Forrest Gump</h3>

	<p>"Forrest Gump" is one of the best movies of all time, guaranteed. 
		I really just love this movie and it has such a special place in my heart. 
		The performances are just so unforgettable and never get out of your head. The characters, 
		I mean the actors turned into them and that's what got to me. The lines are so memorable, 
		touching, and sometimes hilarious.</p>

<h3>3. Catch me if you can</h3>

<p>'Catch Me if You Can' has such a talented cast, the true story is a fascinating one and 
	while Steven Spielberg is 
	an inconsistent director he was a big childhood influence and 
	he has proved several times that he is capable of masterpieces of iconic status.</p>
